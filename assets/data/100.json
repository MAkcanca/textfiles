SJ Games were unable to have their game back for 7 months, during which time it was described as some sort of \"hacking manual\" that the country had to be protected from.

After a while, everyone not personally involved in the bitchwar is driven away, posting messages on other sub-boards, which causes them to be insulted for not posting on the right sub-board, possibly leading to another bitchwar.
